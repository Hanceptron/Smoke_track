## Error Analysis

The error "Unable to resolve module ./src/screens/HomeScreen" from `/Users/emirhan/Documents/Projects/Smoke/SmokingTracker/App.js` is caused by an incorrect file path in an import statement.

*   **File:** `/Users/emirhan/Documents/Projects/Smoke/SmokingTracker/App.js`
*   **Line:** 3
*   **Issue:** The import statement `import HomeScreen from './src/screens/HomeScreen';` uses `HomeScreen` with a capital 'S'.
*   **Correction:** The actual file is named `Homescreen.js` with a lowercase 's'. The import statement should be `import HomeScreen from './src/screens/Homescreen';` to match the filename. Case sensitivity in module resolution is likely causing this issue.
